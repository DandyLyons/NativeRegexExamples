# Getting Started

## Overview
Welcome to NativeRegexExamples! This package serves as a helpful repository of regular expressions in the Swift language. These regular expressions are free to be used in your own projects. You can import the entire library. Or you can simply copy and paste only the regular expressions that you need. (This way you can avoid adding an unnecessary dependency.)

This library also hosts an extensive test suite. Here you can plainly see the strengths and weaknesses of each regular expression. Learn what matches and does not match. The test suite also includes tests to identify false-positives and false-negatives

>To learn more see: <doc:Using-the-Test-Suite>.
